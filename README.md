# CD-List-Classical-Chronological
There are times when I want to scoop up all of my classical CDs, and get a dog to slobber all over the silver side. 

The ages of the land: 

Died c. 1750: I'm pretty sure that I'm better than you. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. 

Died c. 1800: By the request of my liberal master, The lord of Netherfield Park, you are hereby invited to attend....

Died c. 1850: When I go out on the moor to cry, it rains, as the sky wishes to cry with me.

Died c. 1900: Well, I don't really care so much if dad thinks that we shouldn't go to the ballet. He'll get over it, unfortunately.... It's almost over; it's about to begin. 

Died c. 1950: Will there still be ballet after the revolution?.... Well, whose revolution? That of the Soviets, or that of the anti-Soviets?

Died c. 2000: Hello? Hello in there! Gimme the flashlight. Wow, it's like the building died.... Do you think they stopped paying their taxes or something? 

Died c. 1750

Vivaldi: 

Vivaldi may have been the antique Roman apostle to the violins and the orphaned daughters of scandal, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the only one not too lazy to invent an actual frickin' title for his classical compositions. On July 28, 1741 the time and the season called for his death, so he died. 

Vivaldi Quote: Baroque? Well, you know what they say: if it ain't baroque, don't fix it! Quip quip! But seriously, hide me from Handel: the British Royal Family's German opera mercenary? Is that, well, of course it's allowed. But myself am completely.... Well, Italian, okay. But I can use those rich outcast girls as my human shields. It's the only strategy, that I could think of, in these ancient times....

JS Bach: 

Origin Bach may have been the cranky, authoritarian grandfather of ancient times, who wanted life to follow brain-y, strait-laced schoolmaster rules, but of all the composers, he had perhaps the largest brain, that is estimated to have contained an encyclopedia of musics. On July 28, 1750, his brain exploded, and he died. 

JS Bach Quote: You remember the quadratic equation?.... Good. Then you are permitted to go home and sleep. 

Died c. 1800

Mozart: 

Mozart may have sometimes had a personality like a childish teenager, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the one most likely to be energetic and happy. It has been severely documented that on December 5, 1791, Salieri killed him because he was jealous of his girlfriend, and so he died. 

Mozart Quote: Yes, no more rules, no more Emperor Romulus, no more.... Ah, this is good wine. I hope an Italian didn't make it; I don't want to have to feel jealous. We're all Germans; there's no oxygen. Stop. It's Clementi. I hate him. He dances better than I do. I need to find some way to poison his reputation....

Haydn: 

Haydn may have been a funny old, persistent, consistent, country gentleman fellow and occasional London Town aficionado, but of all the composers, he had perhaps the most sincere, fatherly affection for his child-like colleagues. On May 31, 1809, they had to read his will, because he died. 

Haydn Quote: I found the gentleman to be mild but reserved, and the lady, happy but jealous. 

Clementi:

Clementi may be this obscure Anglo-Italic from the Kingdom of the Germans who you'll only ever hear about if you take up piano, but of all the people who you'll only ever hear about if you're a pianist, Clementi is perhaps the one least likely to be merely an affectation of rich people and nothing else. Clementi wanted you to play it smooth: alas, the land was not prepared. Germany was not prepared. On March 10, 1832, after years of being somewhat old and useless, he died and lots of dirt, along with the pathetic surviving vestiges of the whole old-style of Vienna dance parties, was scooped into his grave. 

Clementi Quote: I don't really like Mozart operas. My moral sense is violated. And then, I can almost hear him giggle.

Died c. 1850

Chopin: 

Chopin may have been this weird, sickly, fainting artist with morose, disturbed friends, but of all the composers, he was the one most skilled in putting vampires to sleep. On October 17, 1849, a vampire ripped out his heart in Paris and carried it with him back to Poland, which is why he died. 

Chopin Quote: There's a scratch on my white napkin.... Cancer! It's cancer. 

R Schumann: 

Robert may have been this guy married to some chick with a far more goodly supply of PC points--as though ANY.... and may have had a slightly flexible relationship with reality, his mail always overflowing with musics delivered him by spirits, but of all the composers of a morose and creepy age, he was ironically perhaps the only one not to be completely bat-shit. On July 28, 1856, he transitioned into being a spirit himself. 

Robert Schumann Quote: I can explain this crazy world, ironically, I guess. Like I'm crazy and they're not, they out there in Germany, right.... Anyway:

Captain Chauvinism: I prefer the grey-bun governess chick, because she is only female that I have ever met in entire course of my life. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: Okay, these people: they come from far away-- the roads are long, and land is distant. Now, your girl, that you actually know: she's in ballet.... She's not dead, and so on. You see. 

Captain Chauvinism: Oh, you're right. I forgot about all that. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: Right, so, were talking about some sort of landlord character-- 

Captain Chauvinism: Hold on. *phone* No! Tell the renters that if they want the utilities to actually work, I'm going to raise their rent! I sent you to school for a reason, bitch! Come through for me! *phone away* I'm sorry. Continue. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: *winces* Okay. So.... Okay, so do you want this, municipal support type for the ballet girls to be all like, all grey-bun governess, like.... "Oh, so you're prettier than me, is that it? Well, then I'll turn totally feral on you, and stab! Stab!" Now, if it were like, Richard Nazi or something--

Captain Chauvinism: What does that have to do with the girl's life. We're talking about relativism hiding inside statistics. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: (ignoring him) But if he's like, Strauss the Party-master: "Come to the party! Bring a bottle of wine! Ah! Be good to us!" And not a grey-bun governess. You see. 

Captain Chauvinism: My tastes are objective.... And communism is the answer. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: You're tolerating elite, ritzy culture either way: they're all.... All of them. But if it's pretty.... I mean, you don't always get some Strauss type, writing something like ballet: you don't always get to the very top of the mountain. But with somebody like Robert, he's almost more basic, but he's not as creepy and morbid, and certainly not pretentious on top of that, like a lot of that generation or whatever. So, that's a benefit. You don't get, like, a free party with the rent, but he just sorta shuffles over for the rent: he's not a rent Nazi. Do you understand the benefit now? Are you going to stop being aggressive? 

Captain Chauvinism: Well.... 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: .... Yes? 

Captain Chauvinism: Well, if we have to tolerate the elite, maybe we can surpass that, even, and tell the peasants that they're monkeys: eventually even Mozart or whoever-

Hermes the Psychiatrist: His orderly and thought-provoking yet entertaining music helps people cope with emotional disturbances and process things more effectively. 

Captain Chauvinism: Yeah, even Mozart or whoever will be all like: Quite skilled, for a monkey. And Russians are even worse: they don't do the strange, subtle thingBut I prefer General Craig Haig, the right arm of the Pope: the apostle of the simple truth which the pompous deny. 
Hermes the Psychiatrist: I'm sorry; you're breaking up. "Apple trees dance in the sea"? 
Captain Chauvinism: Because you're not as arrogant as I am, you are far more arrogant than I am. 
Hermes the Psychiatrist: *sighs in defeat* *flips opens a book* Okay: let's look at our options in terms of pills. 
Captain Chauvinism: *still babbling* I blame Ringo. 
Hermes the Psychiatrist: *looking at a page* More severe, maybe.... *flips, then* No, Ringo was the greatest. 

.... I mean.... Chopin was okay; he certainly had talent, clearly. And he wasn't pretentious or fake, you have to give him that. He was-- he was just like that. 

Village Psychiatrist: *tired* Okay, which one of you was, ah, "paranoid melancholia", or whatever it was. 
Robert Schumann: *pointing* Him! It was him! 
Village Psychiatrist: Don't worry, son. Science and civilization are advancing. Pretty soon they'll be building the very first "Doctor Pepper" factories. You're in good hands. 
Chopin: No, no, ah!..... Ah!..... 
*he gets dragged away* 
17-yr. old Demeter: So mean, dad. 
Robert Schumann: Well, he's very melancholic, a little paranoid.... So it's true, or plausible, or something. 

Which is more than you can say, sometimes, don't you think? 

Nuclear Fission Mom: Robert, you little motherfucker! 
Chauvinist: That's right, Robert. I'm just gonna step out for a minute, but.... Whatever. I'm pretty moral: not like you.... I mean, I'm so weak, and I feel so guilty, so you'd better be the one. 
*leaves* 
Nuclear Fission Mom: Robert-- 
Artemis: Is coming with me. So don't make me cut you, bitch. 

*later* 
Robert Shoemahn: So how did you like it. It was called, "Carnival Ferry in C Major". 
Aphrodite: I wasn't sleeping; it was good. 
Dionysios: *fat generosity* It was wonderful, little man! 
Fleetwood Mac Guy: *Dionysios hair* Yeah man, it was really cool. 
Mozart: So much better, what I write. 
Aphrodite: *laughs lazily, fondles Wolfie's hair* Always jealous, Robert Clementi, somebody. My little governess. 

Died c. 1900

Tchaikovsky: 

Tchaikovsky may have communicated with his friends solely by mail, for the benefit of future historians, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the greatest champion of ballerinas and the Soviet Union. On (date), a Wagnerite infiltrator in the vanguard of evil poisoned his drinking water, and he died. 

Tchaikovsky Quote: What do you think, Drosselmeyer, is there any hope for people like us? "I think you've got it bad enough, Peter, and you make it worse for yourself by trying to help everybody else." Well, Drosselmeyer, I try to be that one who isn't a slander to all the others. 

J Strauss: 

Strauss the Son may have been this guy who wrote dance music because it's fun, but of all the composers, he is perhaps the master of rich girl music, which is basically what classical music is. On (date), the rich girls mourned dramatically, upon hearing that he had died. 

Johann Strauss Quote: In the old days I think they wrote good dances for dancing with people you don't really know, yet, and I write good dances for when you're with your friends. 

Brahms

Brahms Quote: I feel alienated from the people around me: isolated. It's a burden, trying not to be contemptible like the others. I often feel afraid of the people around me. North Germans. White people. I feel my opinion of them slipping further and further, over time. Pompous white people. Grasping, empty, quarrelsome white people. White people who are alienated from each other, and isolated from nature. I feel afraid: I don't know what they do to me, when I'm just hanging around. I know that the people in Africa probably feel sad because we destroyed their continent, but I feel sad because I get to live among the North German whites. I feel quite sad, about my life. Maybe I'll write some more shitty music later: there are times, when I don't really dig my whole scene. I think I'm going to go take a walk in the woods. A nice, long walk in the woods. 

Died c. 1950

Gershwin

Prokofiev

Died c. 2000

"Steve Carell"

"Steve Carell" Quote: I love Beethoven. I am a white person, therefore, Beethoven is my King, and my Emperor. I listen to Beethoven, I listen to Beethoven on vinyl. I'm going to ship my kid to some island where there are no doctors and the village is populated by vaguely abusive cartoon character children, and see if that makes them as good at math as JS Bach, or JC Bach, Mozart's friend, who hated his father.... Ah! Civil rights: the end of music. I mean, hang out with really white really bourgeoise people: doesn't it sound like music? I mean, bug music, but. Beethoven, though: the Emperor of *white people*, the Napoleon of music.... What is this? A stop sign? Do I have to stop here, too. Mozart bought on credit, Bach was grudgingly given food to eat by the village church idiots: But Beethoven, I don't think that the laws applied to him, because he was too white, for all that jazz.... He had a license to kill, Beethoven did. Like white people bickering their bug music into existence: they don't think the law applies to them.... But, ah, it's good to be alive. I write music all the time. I actually want to write a ballet, for my daughter to be in. I'm going to have my daughter do the interview with the magazine: maybe I'll bop in for five minutes and tell a string of jokes. I'm sure that the Beethoven Club will riot, burn a few cars. I hope they get arrested. I hate white people, like I hate Beethoven. I hate all white people. No exceptions for the most obnoxious.
