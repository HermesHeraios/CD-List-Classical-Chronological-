# CD-List-Classical-Chronological
There are times when I want to scoop up all of my classical CDs, and get a dog to slobber all over the silver side. 

The ages of the land: 

Died c. 1750: I'm pretty sure that I'm better than you. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. 

Died c. 1800: By the request of my liberal master, The lord of Netherfield Park, you are hereby invited to attend....

Died c. 1850: When I go out on the moor to cry, it rains, as the sky wishes to cry with me.

Died c. 1900: Well, I don't really care so much if dad thinks that we shouldn't go to the ballet. He'll get over it, unfortunately.... It's almost over; it's about to begin. 

Died c. 1950: Will there still be ballet after the revolution?.... Well, whose revolution? That of the Soviets, or that of the anti-Soviets?

Died c. 2000: Hello? Hello in there! Gimme the flashlight. Wow, it's like the building died.... Do you think they stopped paying their taxes or something? 

Died c. 1750

Vivaldi: 

Vivaldi may have been the antique Roman apostle to the violins and the orphaned daughters of scandal, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the only one not too lazy to invent an actual frickin' title for his classical compositions. On July 28, 1741 the time and the season called for his death, so he died. 

Vivaldi Quote: Baroque? Well, you know what they say: if it ain't baroque, don't fix it! Quip quip! But seriously, hide me from Handel: the British Royal Family's German opera mercenary? Is that, well, of course it's allowed. But myself am completely.... Well, Italian, okay. But I can use those rich outcast girls as my human shields. It's the only strategy, that I could think of, in these ancient times....

JS Bach: 

Origin Bach may have been the cranky, authoritarian grandfather of ancient times, who wanted life to follow brain-y, strait-laced schoolmaster rules, but of all the composers, he had perhaps the largest brain, that is estimated to have contained an encyclopedia of musics. On July 28, 1750, his brain exploded, and he died. 

JS Bach Quote: You remember the quadratic equation?.... Good. Then you are permitted to go home and sleep. 

* Goldberg Variations (1741/1993/2011) [Andrei Gavrilov: piano], Universal, 478 3383 [solo piano]

{Yeah, okay, Bach. I mean, fuck you, Bach, but okay. Now get out of my face.}

Died c. 1800

(Classical #3?) Mozart: 

Mozart may have sometimes had a personality like a childish teenager, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the one most likely to be energetic and happy. It has been severely documented that on December 5, 1791, Salieri killed him because he was jealous of his girlfriend, and so he died. 

Mozart Quote: Yes, no more rules, no more Emperor Romulus, no more.... Ah, this is good wine. I hope an Italian didn't make it; I don't want to have to feel jealous. We're all Germans; there's no oxygen. Stop. It's Clementi. I hate him. He dances better than I do. I need to find some way to poison his reputation....

(Classical #2) Haydn: 

Haydn may have been a funny old, persistent, consistent, country gentleman fellow and occasional London Town aficionado, but of all the composers, he had perhaps the most sincere, fatherly affection for his child-like colleagues. On May 31, 1809, they had to read his will, because he died. 

Haydn Quote: I found the gentleman to be mild but reserved, and the lady, happy but jealous. 

Clementi:

Clementi may be this obscure Anglo-Italic from the Kingdom of the Germans who you'll only ever hear about if you take up piano, but of all the people who you'll only ever hear about if you're a pianist, Clementi is perhaps the one least likely to be merely an affectation of rich people and nothing else. Clementi wanted you to play it smooth: alas, the land was not prepared. Germany was not prepared. On March 10, 1832, after years of being somewhat old and useless, he died and lots of dirt, along with the pathetic surviving vestiges of the whole old-style of Vienna dance parties, was scooped into his grave. 

Clementi Quote: I don't really like Mozart operas. My moral sense is violated. And then, I can almost hear him giggle.

Died c. 1850

Chopin: 

Chopin may have been this weird, sickly, fainting artist with morose, disturbed friends, but of all the composers, he was the one most skilled in putting vampires to sleep. On October 17, 1849, a vampire ripped out his heart in Paris and carried it with him back to Poland, which is why he died. 

Chopin Quote: There's a scratch on my white napkin.... Cancer! It's cancer. 

R Schumann: 

Robert may have been this guy married to some chick with a far more goodly supply of PC points--as though ANY.... [of these fucking white people deserve that.... As though emptiness deserves something good.... *Ah*....] and may have had a slightly flexible relationship with reality, his mail always overflowing with musics delivered him by spirits, but of all the composers of a morose and creepy age, he was ironically perhaps the only one not to be completely bat-shit. On July 28, 1856, he transitioned into being a spirit himself. 

Robert Schumann Quote: I can explain this crazy world, ironically, I guess. Like I'm crazy and they're not, they out there in Germany, right.... Anyway:

Captain Chauvinism: I prefer the grey-bun governess chick, because she is only female that I have ever met in entire course of my life. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: Okay, these people: they come from far away-- the roads are long, and land is distant. Now, your girl, that you actually know: she's in ballet.... She's not dead, and so on. You see. 

Captain Chauvinism: Oh, you're right. I forgot about all that. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: Right, so, we were talking about some sort of landlord character-- 

Captain Chauvinism: Hold on. *phone* No! Tell the renters that if they want the utilities to actually work, I'm going to raise their rent! I sent you to school for a reason, bitch! Come through for me! *phone away* I'm sorry. Continue. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: *winces* Okay. So.... Okay, so do you want this, municipal support type for the ballet girls to be all like, all grey-bun governess, like.... "Oh, so you're prettier than me, is that it? Well, then I'll turn totally feral on you, and stab! Stab!" Now, if it were like, Richard Nazi or something--

Captain Chauvinism: What does that have to do with a girl's life. We're talking about relativism hiding inside statistics. *Whiteness*.

Hermes the Psychiatrist: (ignoring him) But if he's like, Strauss the Party-master: "Come to the party! Bring a bottle of wine! Ah! Be good to us!" And not a grey-bun governess. You see. 

Captain Chauvinism: My tastes are objective.... And communism is the answer. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: You're tolerating elite, ritzy culture either way: they're all.... All of them. But if it's pretty.... I mean, you don't always get some Strauss type, writing something like ballet: you don't always get to the very top of the mountain. But with somebody like Robert, he's almost more basic, but he's not as creepy and morbid, and certainly not pretentious on top of that, like a lot of that generation or whatever. So, that's a benefit. You don't get, like, a free party with the rent, but he just sorta shuffles over for the rent: he's not a rent Nazi. Do you understand the benefit now? Are you going to stop being aggressive? 

Captain Chauvinism: Well.... 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: .... Yes? 

Captain Chauvinism: Well, if we have to tolerate the elite, maybe we can surpass that, even, and tell the peasants that they're monkeys: eventually even Mozart or whoever-

Hermes the Psychiatrist: His orderly and thought-provoking yet entertaining music helps people cope with emotional disturbances and process things more effectively. 

Captain Chauvinism: Yeah, even Mozart or whoever will be all like: Quite skilled, for a monkey. And Russians are even worse: they don't do the strange, subtle thing: "sonata form"-- the wall between you and a hateful reality which is difficult to process. Civilization. (Like that cartoony game about genocide made by that Jewish guy named Meier, who packed it full of relativism.) They do this thing, the Russia Land of Contrasts thing, (not Germany Land of little office worker bourgeois white people), where each theme is more like a song or an independent track and not subtly derived from the one that came before it, like one of those infinite regression loops: I'm holding a picture of a guy who has a mirror, but inside that picture, there's *another* guy.... Ironically, that's the anti-Russian thing: Oh, and they got anti-Russian.... I mean, in many ways, it's broadly similar, but you can detect this subtle difference between more subtle and meaningless, feeble distinctions on the German side, and more striking and healthy, intense contrasts on the Russian side: and it's important to hate people if you can think of a reason. The Russians weren't sufficiently distant from the land and the people: they still had songs in their head, literally.... It's a bridge to a place you can't control.... But yeah. I prefer General Craig Haig, the right arm of the Pope: the apostle of the simple truth which the pompous deny. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: I'm sorry; you're breaking up. "Apple trees dance in the sea"? And besides, in that paragraph you were too much of a literal sock-puppet. Try to stay in character, Captain McNazi. 

Captain Chauvinism: Sorry. But yeah, because you're not as arrogant as I am, you are far more arrogant than I am. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: *sighs in defeat* *flips opens a book* Okay: let's look at our options in terms of pills. 

Captain Chauvinism: *still babbling* I blame Ringo. 

Hermes the Psychiatrist: *looking at a page* More severe, maybe.... *flips, then* No, Ringo was the greatest. 

Florestan Eusebiovich: You're ill, Peter. 

Peter Tchaikovsky: Exactly.

Florestan Eusebiovich: I'm being very sincere, and non-sarcastic, right now. 

Peter Tchaikovsky: Well, of course, the facts are on your side.... After all, the facts *are* on your side: you're a German. 

Florestan Eusebiovich: I'm an entertainer. 

Peter Tchaikovsky: You utilize the maple leaf for this purpose. 

Florestan Eusebiovich: A rag is not just--

Peter Tchaikovsky: All right, cut it out with the puns. 

.... I mean.... Chopin was okay; he certainly had talent, clearly. And he wasn't pretentious or fake, you have to give him that. He was-- he was just like that. 

Village Psychiatrist: *tired* Okay, which one of you was, ah, "paranoid melancholia", or whatever it was. 

Robert Schumann: *pointing* Him! It was him! 

Village Psychiatrist: Don't worry, son. Science and civilization are advancing. Pretty soon they'll be building the very first "Doctor Pepper" factories. You're in good hands. 

Chopin: No, no, ah!..... Ah!..... 

*he gets dragged away* 

17-yr. old Demeter: So mean, dad. 

Robert Schumann: Well, he's very melancholic, and a little paranoid.... So it's true, or plausible, or something. 

Which is more than you can say, sometimes, don't you think? 

Nuclear Fission Mom: Robert, you little motherfucker! 

Chauvinist: That's right, Robert. I'm just gonna step out for a minute, but.... Whatever. I'm pretty moral: not like you.... I mean, I'm so weak, and I feel so guilty, so you'd better be the one. 

*leaves* 

Nuclear Fission Mom: Robert-- 

Artemis: Is coming with me. So don't make me cut you, bitch. 

*later* 

Robert Shoemahn: So how did you like it. It was called, "Carnival Ferry in C Major". 

Aphrodite: I wasn't sleeping; it was good. 

Dionysios: *fat generosity* It was wonderful, little man! 

Fleetwood Mac Guy: *Dionysios hair* Yeah man, it was really cool. 

Mozart: So much better, what I write. 

Aphrodite: *laughs lazily, fondles Wolfie's hair* Always jealous, Robert Clementi, somebody. My little governess. 

John Mayer: You're like twenty-two girls in one-uh, uh-un. 

And none of them know what they're running fro-uh, uh-un....

Mozart: I am very consistent, myself, not like Robert Schumann.... Italiani sono.... crapperlicherkeit! 

John Mayer: You're like twenty-one girls in one-uh, uh-un. 

And none of them know what they're running fro-uh, uh-um. 

Taylor Swift: *going through her albums with Maeve, Morgana and Macha, she mumbles absent-mindedly* Yeah, who the hell am I right.... *then she catches herself, and, tilting her head like an animated doll, she says* No, I know exactly who I am. I'm Swifty. 

John Mayer: I'm sorry. I'm afraid of you. I'm going to hide in the hills. I'm leaving my cell phone here, so that no one will be able to contact me. No one will be able to find me. 

Died c. 1900

(Classical #1) Tchaikovsky: 

Tchaikovsky may have communicated with his friends solely by mail, for the benefit of future historians, but of all the composers, he was perhaps the greatest champion of ballerinas and the Soviet Union. On November 6 or whatever--Russian calendar! Woot!, 1893, a Wagnerite infiltrator in the vanguard of evil poisoned his drinking water, and he died. 

Tchaikovsky Quote: What do you think, Drosselmeyer, is there any hope for people like us? "I think you've got it bad enough, Peter, and you make it worse for yourself by trying to help everybody else." Well, Drosselmeyer, I try to be that one who isn't a slander to all the others. 

* The Nutcracker: Highlights (1892/1985/1996) [Philharmonia Orchestra, Michael Tilson Thomas], Sony SFK 62675 [ballet]

{That a child of the world would want to risk this great beauty, so that they can chew iron with the krauts, makes me exceeding angry and very very angry. Imagine me doing something dramatic. Now imagine me doing something more dramatic.}

J Strauss: 

Strauss the Son may have been this guy who wrote dance music because it's fun, but of all the composers, he is perhaps the master of rich girl music, which is basically what classical music is. On June 3, 1899, the rich girls mourned dramatically, upon hearing that he had died. 

Johann Strauss Quote: In the old days I think they wrote good dances for dancing with people you don't really know, yet, and I write good dances for when you're with your friends. 

Brahms

Brahms Quote: I feel alienated from the people around me: isolated. It's a burden, trying not to be contemptible like the others. I often feel afraid of the people around me. North Germans. White people. I feel my opinion of them slipping further and further, over time. Pompous white people. Grasping, empty, quarrelsome white people. White people who are alienated from each other, and isolated from nature. I feel afraid: I don't know what they do to me, when I'm just hanging around. I know that the people in Africa probably feel sad because we destroyed their continent, but I feel sad because I get to live among the North German whites. I feel quite sad, about my life. Maybe I'll write some more shitty music later: there are times, when I don't really dig my whole scene. I think I'm going to go take a walk in the woods. A nice, long walk in the woods.

Johannes Brahms may have been one of these North German losers who had a really hard time making friends, either ending with no friends at all, or only the most crappy and neurotic of friends, and his air-balloon disaster of a social life ultimately made him palpably miserable, but.... I mean, he sorta thought that his music sucked, too. It, I mean, it's probably bad.... But yeah, on April 3, 1897, it was finally over. *Death was a sweet release*. 

Girl Quote: You spent twenty years, writing that piece of crap. You're basically worthless, okay. It's like, Access feebleness! You know. God. Fuck everybody. *Ah!*

Died c. 1950

Gershwin

Special Note: This is the part where I refuse to acknowledge the author of "Judaism in Music" as a member of the fellowship of humanity. I take it upon myself to banish him from the village.... There's plenty of illness without the bizarre superlative.... That's like a special bonus lecture. Like, I feel a certain affinity for the French, and their Impressionist/hospital painting music, I sorta like ("Pavane"), but actually I hate it. I feel acutely offended when French people turn out to be colonial shithead racists, as they all are. Very expensive, a French person. Squirrels collect nuts, but French people collect arrogance. At least France doesn't manufacture cars anymore, although actually it simply went to Germany: so skilled, the white people. You want to go to Hell? We'll clear a path.... "French and German are different things, even if you can't remember the details of French grammar which grammar Nazis will crucify you over...." (Stalin: How do you say, "Rzeznik"? Molotov: Just point to him and say, You. Stalin: You're really pissed today. That's the secret reason why Molotov does not lead this country.... Molotov: Just point to me and say, You.) Yeah, we're so different from Germans: there's no reason to get upside. "My name is Erik Satie, and this is a Grekischie: so French.... Yet so German.... Even one of the moron Anerican GIs from NKVD-less Anerica came back from WWII and was like: I don't like opera anymore.... They should put that on one of those white-washed monuments: Thank you for bombing the land of opera.... I like the Beach Boys do you? "It's automatic, when think of old times.... Come on, let's do it again...." There's a still a Hitler opera village in Germany: turn up that song! Yes! Yes! Do it again! We bombed opera once, now, we can do it again.... "French and German are different things." Although they did have Wagnerites in Russia, even. Hmm.... Berlin Conference: The Fate of Forlorn Africa to be determined by white folk.... It's absurd. You know, maybe if the whole Dryfus thing hadn't happened, then we would have held the line like real men and not little cowardly racist murderers: the airplanes would have been farther away from my picturesque French racist village out of Harry Potter privilege books-- it would have been great: I'm glad it happened that the Russians did it, and we gave them free sodas-- I only wish that we could admit it, since it's an episode we regret. Like if Eric Clapton or John Mayer get wedding anxiety, they go home and wash themselves in the blood of the bluesmen-- if Terry Wogan says something nice to a black person though, it's like: look at the grinning racist-- the fucking white person, *who thinks that actions don't have consequences*.... I get angry, and then I don't care: Hey, Faure, did you write "Golliwog's Cakewalk"? And what's your first name, Henri? Henri Faure-Debussy, the French feminist. Can a man be white, though. But of course! The man can have the most irritating kraut accent, hon hon hon.... All white people are the same. Can white people ever sincerely trust another person? ("The Nazi Bride's Pomp Walk"). (Faure wrote "Chopsticks", and the Harry Potter Bitch wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin"....) Of course: they can trust Richard Wagner. Do actions have consequences: of course not.... Wagner thought it was okay, but yeah, I think it's okay, too, so, you're still bleeding, I don't care-- Oh you love like that, your blood runs cold.... Hey now we got BAD BLOOD, it used to be mad love, but now we got problems, I don't think we can solve them: hey now we got BAD BLOOD! Band-aids don't fix bullet holes you say sorry just for show if you like that, if you with ghosts.... Oh if you love like that, your blood runs cold.... Cause now we got, BAD BLOOD.... You know, the irony is what makes it too much: you people really don't like yourselves much do you.... I'm pretty sure I don't care anymore. Hon hon hon, must obligated it is! Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're a *white person*.... Hey Art. Art Garfunkel. Yeah, motherfucker. I'm talking to you. Play that funky music, white boy. Where the hell did you go to school. Berlin? Yeah, I think I'll call you Jungle Boy from now on, because that place is the pit: the pit of the white.... The heart of darkness. That's right, Art. You fucking motherfucker, I'm talking to you. Cause now we got problems, cause you got BAD BLOOD. Try to get yourself clean. Get yourself clean, white boy. Clean yourself up. Come on, George. Let's go. *George Gershwin simply un-leans off of the thing, and we walk out together, as though he were Molotov*

George Gershwin may have been just another serious white person with no sense of the ironic, you know, Patton Oswalt as Doug Heffernan's black friend, (Kevin James: Ooh, that doesn't sound like a very good idea, buddy. *in a loud whisper* We should buy more advanced technology), but out of all the composers, he was perhaps the one who spent the most time writing stuff for Frank Sinatra, no, older, Bing Crosby, to do, so that sly songs could be sung in ye old shopping center.... But despite his best efforts to bridge feuds, Gershwin was indeed more popular in certain circles, (and/or countries) than others. In a sorta fortunate way for him, if not for us, he died before certain things happened, on July 11, 1937. 

Gershwin Quote: Let's go to the St. Patrick's Day Parade. I want to feel really embarrassed, in a generous way. 

Prokofiev

Special note: I also wrote something about Prokofiev awhile ago. Do you want to know what I wrote? (Do you want to know a secret? Do you promise not to tell? We're standing beside a wishing well....)

Well, yeah, I know what I wrote, at least.... You know, they'll be some idiot thug, lazy thug: they're all the same. It's like-- Yeah, I agree. Your life really *isn't* worth figuring out. ("The great patience to be so.... As they all are." People don't listen to you if you say meaningless, literal things.)

Like John Rzeznik said in "Acoustic #3": "What's the point in all the screaming. You're not listening, anyway." 

Basically, this is what I should write: imagine something really bad.... And then, imagine something, even worse. 

Imagine a mountain. (Camera on mountain.) And now, imagine.... A larger mountain. (The camera lurches forward.)

I don't really decide that I'm going to explain something, but then somebody does something exceptionally stupid.... 

I'm just gonna write a coda: Georgy had a bad day. 

Georgy Classified: I had shit day. Nothing is in its right place-- not food, not music, nothing. 

Dan Keyes: If it takes away the pain: it's alright. (Stand up, break free.) We're living so hard, you might not make it through tonight. (Stand up....) Follow the bright lights (bright lights) they might change you (stand up, break free). If you get lost along the way, it's alright.... (Bright lights: can't you see?)

Georgy Classified: And yet, my life is basically shit. 

Gossip Girl: (Georgy doesn't like us anymore: he's in the NKVD.) 

Georgy Classified: I am in shit mood for awhile. Eventually I am not, but unfortunately I am still right. 

Gossip Girl: (Oh, I'm guilty, Georgy! I'm guilty! I'm too Russian! I ought to, be shot!)

Georgy Classified: If only every time man does wrong, it is joke. 

Gossip Girl: [I'm so white, it is a joke.]

Georgy Classified: (stands up, walks up to her, all uniform-like) You are very young, little girl. But you are bad person. Soon you will be older, but Siberia, still cold. And you act this way, your blood runs cold. *walks away*

Prokofiev may have been born to a bunch of blood-sucking parasites who crush the soul of the workers with their elitist noise which nobody sincerely likes, and he may have been a bit of a strait-laced prick in school, but out of all of the composers, he was the only one who wrote a Cinderella ballet for a Soviet dictator. He could do all kinds of crazy cool shit, Sergei Prokofiev, because he was Stalin's composer, and he wasn't afraid of opening doors. To underline the fact that he was a pretty cool kid, he decided to co-ordinate his death with that of the guy who saved humanity from Hitler, on March 5, 1953. (Or, maybe, you know: when The King of Egypt dies, sometimes you toss somebody else in after him, to keep him company.)

Prokofiev Quote: Cheers! (everybody says cheers) To Equality, to Justice, and to Comrade Stalin. (everybody repeats this). *he raises his cup to his lips, and mumbles into the cup* (And to the Soviet National Ballet.) (Everybody hears anyway, and laughs, saying, *to the soviet national ballet*, all secret secret commie like.)

Died c. 2000

"Steve Carell"

"Steve Carell" Quote: I love Beethoven. I am a white person, therefore, Beethoven is my King, and my Emperor. I listen to Beethoven, I listen to Beethoven on vinyl. I'm going to ship my kid to some island where there are no doctors and the village is populated by vaguely abusive cartoon character children, and see if that makes them as good at math as JS Bach, or JC Bach, Mozart's friend, who hated his father.... Ah! Civil rights: the end of music. I mean, hang out with really white really bourgeoise people: doesn't it sound like music? I mean, bug music, but. Beethoven, though: the Emperor of *white people*, the Napoleon of music.... What is this? A stop sign? Do I have to stop here, too. Mozart bought on credit, Bach was grudgingly given food to eat by the village church idiots: But Beethoven, I don't think that the laws applied to him, because he was too white, for all that jazz.... He had a license to kill, Beethoven did. Like white people bickering their bug music into existence: they don't think the law applies to them.... But, ah, it's good to be alive. I write music all the time. I actually want to write a ballet, for my daughter to be in. I'm going to have my daughter do the interview with the magazine: maybe I'll bop in for five minutes and tell a string of jokes. I'm sure that the Beethoven Club will riot, burn a few cars. I hope they get arrested. I hate white people, like I hate Beethoven. I hate all white people. No exceptions for the most obnoxious.
